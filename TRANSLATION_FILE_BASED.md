### New Behavior (Better):

## 📁 File Naming Convention

Translated subtitle files use ISO language codes:

├── movie.es-ES.srt  (Spanish Spain)
├── movie.zh-CN.srt  (Chinese Simplified)
└── movie.fr.srt     (French)
```

### Language Codes:

| Portuguese (Portugal) | pt-PT | movie.pt-PT.srt |
| Spanish (Spain) | es-ES | movie.es-ES.srt |
| Spanish (Latin America) | es-LA | movie.es-LA.srt |
| Chinese (Simplified) | zh-CN | movie.zh-CN.srt |
| Chinese (Traditional) | zh-TW | movie.zh-TW.srt |
| French | fr | movie.fr.srt |
