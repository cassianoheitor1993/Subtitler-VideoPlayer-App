* **List any alternative solutions you've considered**

### Pull Requests

1. **Fork the repository** and create your branch from `main`
2. **Make your changes** following our coding standards
3. **Test your changes** thoroughly
4. **Update documentation** if you've changed functionality
5. **Write a clear commit message** describing your changes
6. **Submit a pull request** with a comprehensive description

## Development Setup

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/SubtitlePlayer.git
cd SubtitlePlayer

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install development dependencies
pip install pytest pytest-qt black flake8

# Run tests
pytest tests/
```

## Coding Standards

### Python Style Guide

We follow PEP 8 with some modifications:

* **Line length**: 100 characters max
* **Indentation**: 4 spaces (no tabs)
* **Imports**: Organized in groups (standard library, third-party, local)
* **Type hints**: Use when appropriate
* **Docstrings**: Google style for all public methods/classes

### Code Formatting

```bash
# Format code with black
black src/ tests/

# Check with flake8
flake8 src/ tests/
```

### Naming Conventions

* **Classes**: `PascalCase` (e.g., `VideoPlayer`, `SubtitleParser`)
* **Functions/Methods**: `snake_case` (e.g., `load_video`, `download_subtitle`)
* **Constants**: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` (e.g., `MAX_FILE_SIZE`, `DEFAULT_FONT`)
* **Private methods**: `_leading_underscore` (e.g., `_internal_method`)

## Testing

All new features should include tests:

```python
# Example test structure
def test_subtitle_parsing():
    parser = SubtitleParser()
    subtitles = parser.parse_srt("test.srt")
    assert len(subtitles) > 0
    assert subtitles[0]['text'] is not None
```

Run tests before submitting:

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest tests/ -v

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_subtitle_parser.py -v

# Run with coverage
pytest tests/ --cov=src --cov-report=html
```

## Git Commit Messages

* **Use present tense** ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* **Use imperative mood** ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* **Limit first line to 72 characters**
* **Reference issues and pull requests** after the first line
