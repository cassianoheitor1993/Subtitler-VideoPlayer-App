# Translation Progress Bar - Quick Summary

## What Was Added
‚ú® **Visual Progress Bar** for subtitle translation with real-time updates

## The Problem
- Users had no visual feedback during translation
- Large subtitle files (500+ lines) could take 30+ seconds
- No way to know if process was working or frozen
- Translation errors appeared without context
- Timeout errors were confusing

## The Solution
Added a **green progress bar** that:
- Shows percentage completed (0-100%)
- Updates in real-time for each subtitle translated
- Keeps UI responsive during translation
- Automatically hides after completion (1 second delay)
- Immediately hides on error
- Professional styling with rounded corners

## Visual Example

### Before (No Progress Bar)
```
[üåê Translate Subtitles]
Status: üîÑ Translating to Portuguese (Brazil)...
```
*User waits... wondering if it's working...*

### After (With Progress Bar)
```
[üåê Translate Subtitles] (disabled)

‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë 47%

Status: üîÑ Translating subtitle 235/500...
```
*User sees real progress and stays informed!*

## Technical Details

### New Widget
```python
self.translation_progress = QProgressBar()
self.translation_progress.setVisible(False)  # Hidden by default
self.translation_progress.setMinimum(0)
self.translation_progress.setMaximum(100)
self.translation_progress.setTextVisible(True)
```

### Styling
- **Color**: Green (#4CAF50) - indicates success/progress
- **Border**: 2px solid dark gray with rounded corners
- **Height**: 25px for good visibility
- **Text**: Centered percentage display

### Progress Updates
```python
def update_progress(msg, pct):
    self.translation_status.setText(f"{msg}")
    self.translation_progress.setValue(int(pct))
    QApplication.processEvents()  # Keep UI responsive
```

### Lifecycle
1. **Start**: Show at 0% when translation begins
2. **Update**: Real-time updates for each subtitle
3. **Complete**: Set to 100%, wait 1 second, then hide
4. **Error**: Immediately hide and show error message

## User Experience Improvements
