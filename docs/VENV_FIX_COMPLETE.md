# ✅ Translation Issue FIXED - Virtual Environment

## Problem Identified
The app was running but **not using the virtual environment** where `deep-translator` is installed.

### Root Cause
- `run.sh` was looking for `venv/` in the SubtitlePlayer directory
- Actual virtual environment is at `/home/cmedeiros/Documents/Cassiano-Portfolio/.venv/`
- App was using system Python which doesn't have deep-translator

## Solution Applied

### Updated run.sh Script
```bash
# Before:
if [ ! -d "venv" ]; then
    # Only looked for local venv
    
# After:
PARENT_VENV="$(dirname $(dirname "$SCRIPT_DIR"))/.venv"
LOCAL_VENV="$SCRIPT_DIR/venv"

if [ -d "$PARENT_VENV" ]; then
    # Check parent .venv first ✅
    source "$PARENT_VENV/bin/activate"
elif [ -d "$LOCAL_VENV" ]; then
    # Fallback to local venv
    source "$LOCAL_VENV/bin/activate"
```

### Verification
```bash
✓ Virtual environment found: /home/cmedeiros/Documents/Cassiano-Portfolio/.venv
✓ deep-translator version: 1.9.1
✓ App now using correct Python with all packages
✓ Translation feature will work!
```

## Quick Test Command

If you want to verify deep-translator works from terminal:
```bash

from deep_translator import GoogleTranslator
result = GoogleTranslator(source='en', target='pt').translate('Hello World')
print(f'Translated: {result}')
"
```

Expected output: `Translated: Olá Mundo`
